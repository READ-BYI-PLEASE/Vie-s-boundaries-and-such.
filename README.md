# Vie-s-boundaries-and-such.
☾︎☽︎  Introduction  ☾︎☽︎

NOTE: Since fixing my Patreon is taking so long. I'll be using Guthub from now on.

The name is Vie.

I live in the Philippines.

Speaks Filipino/English only.

Fandomless but I love a few characters, these includes:

La Muerte (Book of Life)

Death Wolf (Puss in Boots 2)

Maleficent

Scar (The Lion King)

Notch (Minecraft mythos)

Discord and King Sombra (MLP)

Ceroba (Undertale Yellow)

Asriel (Undertale)

I create OCS based on chess or from any of the topics I randomly read (doesn't mean I am a fan of them): Prehistory, History, Historical Figures, Songs, Nature, Animals.

Yes I fantasize in my mind but the idea of doing it irl icks me off. Not to mention it is also painful, so please do not confuse it for a need to get laid, creep.

I AM SELECTIVELY MUTE. I only interact verbally with my three best friends and gf :).

Yes I make sex jokes, doesn't mean I'm into it irl. Oml.

If you still have an issue with my attitude in the past and haven't moved on from it yet, just block me. No need to burst your damn mouth with nonsense, GODS. Yes I am imperfect and I AM AWARE OF THAT.

People who's into arguments are auto blocked. I don't have time for your bullshit.

I DON'T SUPPORT dating on a pixel horse game. Jesus.

I am an INTJ. Yes. Although I act the opposite to those I trust.

I am a lesbian Christian. Sounds controversial, but idfc.

Please do not ERP with my ocs unless I and my gf crucially trust you, otherwise it icks me off. People who I erpied with my characters before this boundary is set, please respect and never do it again.

My arts, stories, or any projects are heavily 18+, so if that makes you uncomfortable, that is not my problem.

I am not always around, I may want to be alone, or just chilling with my alone time in general. For the sake of my mental health, this is generally for everyone, including my loved ones. So if you see me around not interacting, please don't bother to ask the reason why. Please do not be mad if I need my alone time, as my mental health needs time to heal too. Please do not be furious if sometimes I can't help you out or I have poor time managing. I have my personal life too.

If I am replying late, it means I am currently busy with doing something, either meditating, work, hobbies, eating, researching, or chores and my practices. Please be patient.

Please do not defend on me everyday, again, I have multiple friends, a gf, a messy family, and a life to manage my time with.

I do not accept friend requests in Ponytown or any of my other social medias anymore unless I know you too well and that you keep constantly sitting close to me or interacting with me.

I have multiple friends, a sucking mental health, a gf to take care of, and a personal life. Please do not assume I am ignoring you. Leave if you must, please.

I am mostly active on Ponytown because of my Facebook or other Socials lagging on my laptop, and I have little time to wait for the app to fully load. So please understand.

I have a VERY short temper,

especially with incompetent people. If I see you walking around as a red flag, you're automatic blocked.

I might or might NOT interact with you at Ponytown, that depends on my mood. It's why I am in busy and offline mode, Sometimes, I only need a few people to interact with me.

If I find you icky, judgemental, close minded or just straight up an asshole, you are immediately blocked.

I guess that's all, I might add more at the later time. Anyways, have fun!
