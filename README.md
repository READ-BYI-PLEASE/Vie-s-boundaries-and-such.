☾︎☽︎  Introduction  ☾︎☽︎


The name is Vie.

I'm a certified sapiosexual.

Online family includes Saebre, Sherkivy, Angel and my beloved love, Theo.

I live in the Philippines.

I speak Filipino/English only.

Mainly active on Ponytown, Discord, Rednote, and Messenger. And no I'm not "chronically online".

I do not do ERPs for Psych's sake! I have a damn partner!

Current figure I simp on rn: Psych.
No questions asked. And yes, it's the fucking field.

Fandomless but I love a few characters, these includes:

La Muerte (Book of Life)

Coral Glasses (ENA Dream BBQ)

Death Wolf (Puss in Boots 2)

Notch (Minecraft mythos)

Discord and King Sombra (MLP)

Ceroba (Undertale Yellow)

Asriel (Undertale)

Carol Holiday (Deltarune)

I create OCS based on chess or from any of the topics I randomly read (doesn't mean I am a fan of them): Prehistory, History, Historical Figures, Songs, Nature, Animals.

Yes I fantasize in my mind but the idea of doing it irl icks me off. Not to mention it is also painful, so please do not confuse it for a need to get laid, creep.

Yes I make sex jokes, doesn't mean I'm into it.

If you still have an issue with my attitude in the past and haven't moved on from it yet, just block me oml. No need to burst your damn mouth with nonsense all because of the past, people change, GODS. Yes I am imperfect and I AM AWARE OF THAT.

People who's into arguments are auto blocked unless I find your argument interesting.

I am a lesbian Christian. Sounds controversial, but idfc.

My arts, stories, or any projects are heavily 18+ themed, so if that makes you uncomfortable, that is not my problem.

I am not always around, I may want to be alone, or just chilling with my alone time in general. For the sake of my mental health, this is generally for everyone, including my loved ones. So if you see me around not interacting, please don't bother to ask the reason why. Please do not be mad if I need my alone time, as my mental health needs time to heal too. Please do not be furious if sometimes I can't help you out or I have poor time managing. I have my personal life too.

If I am replying late, it means I am currently busy with doing something, either meditating, work, hobbies, eating, researching, or chores and my practices. Please be patient.

Please do not defend on me everyday, again, I have multiple friends, a gf, a messy family, and a life to manage my time with.

I do not accept friend requests in Ponytown or any of my other social medias anymore unless I know you too well and that you keep constantly sitting close to me or interacting with me.

I have multiple friends, a sucking mental health, a gf to take care of, and a personal life. Please do not assume I am ignoring you. Leave if you must, please.

I have a VERY short temper, so beware, especially with incompetent people. If I see you walking around as a red flag, you're automatic blocked.

I might or might NOT interact with you at Ponytown, that depends on my mood. It's why I am in busy and offline mode, Sometimes, I only need a few people to interact with me.

If I find you icky, judgemental, close minded or just straight up an asshole, you are immediately blocked.

I guess that's all, I might add more at the later time. Anyways, have fun!
